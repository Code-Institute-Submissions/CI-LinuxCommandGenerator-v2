### Squashed Bugs
<!-- Detail discovery/test/fix -->
- Delete confirmation screen would always proceed to delete regardless of whether Delete or Cancel button was selected.
    - **CAUSE**: This was due to the WTForm SubmitField response being a boolean. So the response would always be True regardless of which button was clicked since both are valid Submit buttons.
    - **FIX**: Remove the Cancel version of the SubmitField button and replace with a link to the default Find view.
- pylint validator presents problems/warnings saying *Instance of 'WTForm_with_ReCaptcha' has no 'errors' member*
    - **CAUSE**: See [Nearoo's answer on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52927347)
    - **FIX**: Added .pylintrc file to root directory as outlined in stackoverflow answer
